0x14. C - Bit manipulation Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);

where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars

Return: the converted number, or 0 if

there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1

b is NULL Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n); Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index); Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index); Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index); Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
